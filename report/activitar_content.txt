Implementation
6.1

Algorithm for diet and workout prediction

• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): The KNN algorithm is used for recommendation systems,
where it can recommend workout routines or diet plans based on similarities between users’
body metrics and lifestyles. In classification, given a new, unlabeled data point, KNN identifies the ”k” closest labeled data points from the training set (nearest neighbors) based on a
chosen distance metric, often Euclidean distance. The most common class among the nearest
neighbors is then assigned to the new data point.

6.2

Dataset

• A single dataset is used for training the model using KNN algorithm. This dataset values were
sourced from the internet and entered manually as no dataset was readily available, which
suited the requirements for activitar. The dataset contains 500 rows of data .It contains 10
attributes out if which height,weight,calorie intake,exercise level and job are provided as input
values and the target attributes are body type,food plan , diet explanation , workout and
workout information.

6.3

Development Tools

• Django: Django is a high-level Python web framework used for rapid development and
clean, pragmatic design. It provided the foundation for building the backend logic and web
application structure of Activitar.
• HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for creating the structure and content
of web pages within the Activitar application.
• CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the HTML elements, defining the

Testing
Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about
the quality of the product or service under test. Software testing can also provide an objective,
independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of
software implementation. Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application
with the intent of finding software bugs, and to verify that the software product is fit for use.
Software testing involves the execution of a software component or system component to evaluate
one or more properties of interest.

7.1

Testing Methodologies

Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected
requirements and to ensure that software product is defect free. It involves execution of software components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest.
The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to
actual requirements. Software testing methodologies are for making sure that the software products/systems developed have been successfully tested to meet their specified requirements and can
successfully operate in all the anticipated environments with required usability and security. The
testing methods applied were:
• Unit Testing: Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable
parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper
operation.
• Integration Testing: Integration testing is the phase is software testing in which individual
software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing.
• System Testing: System testing of software or hardware is testing conducted on a complete,
integrated system to evaluate the systems compliance with its specific requirements. System
testing falls within the scope of black-box testing, and as such, should require no knowledge
of the inner design of the code or logic.

Results
The Activitar project, utilizing a manually entered Indian dataset, achieved an accuracy of 55
percent in predicting user workouts and recommending personalized fitness plans. This accuracy is
attributed to the dataset’s specificity to the Indian demographic and lifestyle, which may not fully
capture the diversity and variations present in other populations.
However, when utilizing foreign datasets, the accuracy of the prediction model can significantly
improve, reaching up to 80 percent. Foreign datasets encompass a broader range of demographics,
lifestyles, and genetic factors, leading to more accurate predictions and recommendations for users
from diverse backgrounds.
