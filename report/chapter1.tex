\section{Problem Statement}

In today's fast-paced digital world, effective financial management has become increasingly important for individuals and organizations. Traditional methods of expense tracking using paper-based systems or basic spreadsheets are often inadequate, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Many people struggle with:
